Backtracking Algorithm for Sudoku

This project is an excuse to try Rust Lang which seems be handy language.

Quite simply,

- The programs parses the given sudoku to internal representation
- Then, analyses the raw sudoku to find `early` hints. (Check validity and others)
- Finally comes the solving via a simple Backtracking Algorithm.
